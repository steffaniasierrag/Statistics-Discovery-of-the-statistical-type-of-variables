## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing and evaluating the statistical variable type discovery model proposed in the paper ["Automatic Discovery of the Statistical Types of Variables in a Dataset"](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/valera17a.html), utilizing the R programming language. By conducting simulations to generate diverse datasets, we systematically compare our results with those presented in the original paper. This exploration aims to deepen our understanding of the model's applicability and performance in real-world scenarios. Feel free to explore the details in the sections below.

## Files
In this folder you find the following files:
* VariablesTypesDiscovery_code.R file with the implementation of the algorithm,
* VariablesTypesDiscoverSimulations_datatypes.R with the code that generates the data used for simulations, and the graphics to carry out a simulation analysis,
* the project presentation in the .pdf file.

## Dependencies
* R studio

## Course Content
Completed as part of a Statistics course. This project was developed in collaboration with Alla Usova.
